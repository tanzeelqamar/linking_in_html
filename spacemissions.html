    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Space Missions</h1>
    <blockquote>Space missions have played a vital role in expanding our understanding of the universe. These missions,
        both manned and unmanned, have pushed the boundaries of human exploration and scientific discovery.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Below are some of the most significant space missions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Apollo 11 (1969)</b></li>
        <p>The first mission to land humans on the Moon.
            Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface, while
            Michael Collins orbited in the command module.
            Famous for <strong>Armstrong's</strong> words:
        <blockquote><q>That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.</blockquote></q>
        </p>
        <li><b>Voyager Program (1977)</b></li>
        <p>
            Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched to explore the outer planets of our Solar System.
            Voyager 1 is now the farthest human-made object from Earth, traveling through interstellar space.
            Both spacecraft carry the <b>"Golden Record,"</b> a message for any extraterrestrial life.
        </p>
        <li><b>Mars Rovers</b></li>
        <p>
            <strong> NASA </strong>has sent several rovers to explore <em>Mars</em>, including:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Spirit and Opportunity (2004):</b> Provided vital data about <em>Mars’</em> surface and climate.
            </li>
            <li> <b> Curiosity (2012):</b> Discovered evidence of ancient water and habitability.</li>

            <li> <b> Perseverance (2021):</b> Searching for signs of past life and collecting samples for future
                missions.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <li><b>Hubble Space Telescope (1990)</b></li>
        <p>
            A joint project by <strong> NASA </strong> and <strong>ESA</strong>, this telescope has provided stunning
            images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and stars.It has revolutionized our understanding of the universe's
            age, expansion, and structure.</p>
        <li><b>James Webb Space Telescope (2021)</b></li>
        <p>Designed to see farther into the universe than Hubble.
            Specializes in observing infrared light, allowing it to study the formation of stars, galaxies, and even
            exoplanets.
        </p>
        <li><b>International Space Station (1998-Present)
            </b></li>
        <p>
            A collaborative effort among multiple countries, including the <i>USA, Russia, Japan, and the EU</i>.
            Serves as a research laboratory for studying <em>microgravity, human biology, and Earth observation</em>.

        </p>
        <li><b>SpaceX Missions</b></li>
        <p>
            SpaceX, a private company, has revolutionized space travel with reusable rockets like the <strong>Falcon 9</strong>.
            Its Crew Dragon spacecraft successfully carried astronauts to the International Space Station.
            <strong> SpaceX</strong> is also working on the Starship program for missions to the <em>Moon and Mars</em>.
